      There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the<br />
      majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or<br />
      randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are<br />
      going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't<br />
      anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum<br />
      generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
      necessary,<br />
      making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
      dictionary<br />
      of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence<br />
      structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The
      generated<br />
      Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour,
      or<br />
      non-characteristic words etc.
